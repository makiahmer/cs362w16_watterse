===========================================================================================
Pick a classmate with a working Dominion implementation. In a scratch directory, not in the 
svn repository, run testdominion.c with their code as the dominion implementation. Use diff 
or another tool to compare the gameResults.out from their code with your own code’s results. 
Explain these results, and their value in a file called differential.txt.
===========================================================================================
First off because the games are randomized I'm not sure what we are supposed to compare
between the two. For presumptions sake we shall look at the most common cards played and if
the number of turns taken.

So for the alternate dominion.c file I used Steven Powers'. Somewhat surprisingly the two
runs have very similar occurances, which makes me think rand() was too basic an 
approach for this assignment. The largest difference was that the run on his code chose to
only implement two players vs. three on my code. Beyond that there was a fairly similar 
pattern between both runs. There were very few occurances where one play would implement a
card effect that the other wouldn't, instead they tended to implement card effects around
the same time using different cards. The last large difference was that my game completed in
109 turns whereas the game from his code used 126.

In summation I believe that the main reason games from two different dominion.c files played 
similarly was the use of the generic rand() function vs. a more sophisticated rand system 
such as mt86. Using rand() there was little variation that could be had on the same piece of 
code, assuming our dominion.c files were similar.
