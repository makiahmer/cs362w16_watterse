===================================== Testing Results ======================================
The tests that I wrote covered 20-38% of dominion.c. I believe this is because each test was
focused on a particular aspect (i.e. one function) vs full peices of code (i.e. the function 
and a normal implementation). Throughout my testing I found a short lived bug that I 
created during homework 1, where after moving card effects I return a value from their 
function but I had overlooked returning the value returned by that function in the large
switch statement. The tests that I wrote were written with the goal of making sure that the
action being performed was the desired/expected action's. Thus if a condition is supposed to
fail when passed to that function I pass that condition inside my test block. To a degree I
believe this helps in the codes confidence, however, unlike my some of my counterparts in 
this class I didn't write the tests to utilize randomized testing which would've ensured a 
much larger confidence in the code.
