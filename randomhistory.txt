RandomAdventurer:

	* origional test segfault all the time
	* The rand function of this test generates the same tests ever time
	* so I added srand(time(NULL)) to make the test more random.
	
	* This test uses a pre maded initilaizeGame function, that might or might not be correct so that can be risky
	* This test runs game with same kingdom card every time. It would be better if we can random the kindom card used
	* when attempting to run with random kingdom cards, I ran in to memory issues there for I returned back to using the 
	  given kindom cards. I will probably figure out how to make then do random kingdom card at a later time.
	  
	* I have also notice that this test runs the same kind of test 3 different times in the test. I find this to be just 
	  duplicating code. so I removed the extra 2.
	  
	* As I looked in to the adventurer card, I found a bug adventurer's card affect is suppose to be 
	  draw until you get 2 treasure card in your hand and discard all other drawn card that is not.
	  I am not sure if it is doing what it is supopse to so I checked after I play adventurer
	  
	* The number of card discarded is roughly 30% on test, there might be a problem with discared in adventurer function.

	* also the game would segfault some of the time, I don't know the reason behind this problem as of yet.
	  however the number of segfault seems to relate to the number of tests. as it appears to segfault less on 1,000 test 
	  compared to 10,000 test.
	
	* Overall the origional test was a worse test compared to the updated one I created, however this test is still bad
	  as it segfaults some of the time during execution.
	  
	* Coverage: 24.96 % of 577 lines
