Using the random dominion tester, testdominion.c 
I have produced gameResult.out using my own version of dominion.c
and using my classmate Shannon Ernst's  version of dominion.c I produced gameResult1.c
My tester code appears to work with both mine, and Shannon's dominion code.
Both execution yield a good coverage of both version of the dominion code, yielding 43.50% and 45.25% lined executed.
Using the command "diff gameResults.out gameResults1.out" I got the following results (refer to info below).

After viewing the results produced by diff, I have concluded that the line differences is normal, given that 
the dominion play through using my testers generates random kindom cards, random number of player between 2 to 4,
and randomly assigning each player a favorite card that they would play if they have it in the hand.

to recreate how I obtain the follow result: you do this

for my version: 
	go the directory where my all my dominion related files exist, and just type "make all"
	you can then find the result in the file gameResults.out
	
for getting result using Shannon's dominion code:
	change directory into "assign4classmate_shannon_dominion_c_"
	then jus type "make all"
	you can then find the result in the file gameResults1.out
	
After that you can move gameResult1.out to the directory where all my dominion files exist, and run 
"diff gameResults.out gameResult1s.out >> differential.txt"

The following are the results of the gameResults.out vs gameResults1.out
