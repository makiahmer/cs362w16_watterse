Testing christme dominion.c

From randomized testing, a variance was found in the Adventurer card.
	The problem originally occured when the next player that tried play 
	a card after the adventurer card was played always differed from the 
	oracle. Since I knew that the adventurer card was never supposed to
	interact with any other players, I knew there had to be an issue 
	where the card did just that or failed in such a way that would 
	cascade into the rest of the program somehow. After running the 
	card through unit tests, I never ran into any particular issues.
	It wasn't until I took a look at the dominion.c code and traced 
	what happened after the code completed that I realized that the 
	issue wasn't with the Adventurer card, but with the cardeffect() 
	function's switch statement.
	
	Specifically, the switch statement for the adventurer card doesn't 
	contain a return call. Meaning that once the cards function is called, 
	it coninues on in the cardeffect() function and tries to use the
	return -1; call to exit the function.
	
	Relavent code:
	
	    case adventurer:
			//calls the adventurerCard() function which begins on line
			z = adventurerCard(drawntreasure, z, currentPlayer, state, temphand);
		
	As a side note, z isn't needed here as the function will end promptly 
	after setting z.
