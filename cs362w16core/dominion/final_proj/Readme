The final project comes in 4 parts:

Part 1.) Is located in the folder ./REPORTS/For_Classmates

Part 2.) Is located in the folder ./REPORTS/Part_2 and in the dominion directory

Part 3.) Is located in the folder ./REPORTS/Part_3
	I chose option c.
	
Part 4.) Is located in the folder ./Reports/part_4 and in the dominion directory

I have chosen to add the dominion implementation code of the people who I 
have worked with. They're code has been seperated in the file
./Classmates_Dominion_Files/* . Each person is attributed by their Onid id.

I have stored the bug reports I have been given from other students in the 
folder ./REPORTS/From_Classmates .
